# clipboard_img2txt

Uses Windows 10/11 included OCR engine to extract text from an image in the clipboard, and then adds the text back into the clipboard.

It requires OCR language pack installed; To install them, please look at [Text Extractor utility](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/text-extractor) on Microsoft's documentation (doesn't actually need PowerToys installed).

Also, i don't remember where the OCR script is from. If you know where it's from, tell me and i'll write it down here.
